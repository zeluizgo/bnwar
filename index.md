## Welcome to my github samples code - BNWAR

BNWAr was the acronymn for Bonuses Web Aplication Resource for HR of Citibank Brazil control the bonuses for its executives.
I've just picked up two samples of servlets:

1. Login - The login servlet which processes the login request and redirect (grant or not) to another page into web.
2. CheckUpdate - An Update servlet which processes a form submission and processes the data into database.

And one saple of ORACLE DB Script:

3. kbn_check - An Oracle package with some procedures, one of then "pbn_approve" was used in the ChekUpdate java above.
